# The Meatball Stoppe's v2 project page

The in-progress v2 app for themeatballstoppe.com. If you're in the Orlando area, give us a visit! [YELP](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-meatball-stoppe-orlando-2) - [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/zQhgK1nnauw)

## Development server
Heroku is synced with Github and automatically deploys when the master branch is updated. For this reason 'npm start' will not work locally. Followed [this guide](https://paucls.wordpress.com/2016/11/25/deploy-angular-2-cli-app-to-heroku/) to allow AngularCLI and Heroku play nicely.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to GitHub Pages.

## More details
